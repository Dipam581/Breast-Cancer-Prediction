## Overview
Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in the world. Early diagnosis and prediction play a crucial role in treatment and survival rates. This project implements a predictive model using machine learning techniques to classify breast cancer as malignant or benign.

## Features
- User-friendly interface to input patient data (if applicable).
- Predicts whether breast cancer is benign or malignant.
- Provides insights into the performance metrics of the machine learning model.
- Code for preprocessing, training, and testing is modular and easy to understand.

## Dataset
The project uses the **[Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aayushiweb/breast-cancer-prediction)**, which contains the following:
- Features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) tests.
- Labels: "M" for malignant and "B" for benign.

Key features include:
- Mean, standard error, and worst values for measurements like radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, etc.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas**: Data preprocessing and manipulation.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Model training and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For experimentation and development.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/breast-cancer-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd breast-cancer-prediction
   ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
2. For visualization and exploratory data analysis, use the provided Jupyter notebooks:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Model Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1 Score**
- **ROC-AUC Curve**

Results from the model:
- Training Accuracy: 92%
- Test Accuracy: 96%


## Future Improvements
- Add hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
- Explore other machine learning models and ensemble methods.
- Develop a deployment-ready API for real-time predictions.
